# Udemy Coures - The Complete Junior to Senior Web Development Roadmap

## 1. Motivations

Computer Science, coding stuff were not my things. I was new to this field.
I wanted to learn more about how to be a full stack web developer and to know the differences between junior and senior developer.
In this course, in this repo, I learned and I coded things, topics related below:

- SSH
- React + Redux 
- Webpack + Parcel
- Node.js + Express
- Front End Performance Optimizations
- Back End Performance Optimization
- Progressive Web Apps
- Typescript
- Software Testing
- Server Side Rendering and Client Side Rendering
- Front End Security Optimizations
- Back End Security Optimizations
- Docker
- Redis
- Sessions + JWT
- Amazon Web Services (Lambda)
- Serverless Architecture
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment

## 2. SSH

Use SSH on a remote linux server and generate ssh keys

## 3. Performance Part 1

Create a Progressive Web App that works offline like a native mobile app.

## 4. React, Redux, Module Bundling

Use React and Redux (+ React Hooks) to build complex and large applications.

## 5. Perfomance Part 2

Use Webpack and Parcel to set up a project and bundle your files

## 6. Testing

Write all kinds of tests and learn about all the testing tools you can use to write better software

### Unit Test

### Integration Test

### Automatic Test

## 7. Typescript

Use Typescript on a project to have less bugs in your code

## 8. SPA vs SSR

Decide when to use Server Side Rendering vs Client Side Rendering for your projects

## 9. Security

Implement proper security and securing your apps like an expert

## 10. Code Ananlysis

## 11. Docker

Use Docker and docker compose to create containers for your services

## 12. Redis Database

Use Redis database for session management and caching

## 13. Session and JWT

Use Sessions and JWT to manage user authentication and authorization

## 14. AWS

### Lambda

Use AWS Lambda and Serverless architecture to manage applications that can handle millions of users

## 15. Perfomance Part 3

Improve performance of any web application (Code Splitting, Load Balancing, Caching, Code Optimizations, and much more)

### CDN

### GZIP

GZIP is probably the biggest and the best way to optimize performance.
By default, when you compress a file or folder using the zip command.
It will have the same file name as it did before, but it now will have the extension .gzip and also the files are going to be significantly smaller.
We're simply making these files smaller, something that we're very well aware of, how that benefits performance.

### brotli

Now, there's one thing that was created by Google that is actually a little bit better than GZIP andnd it's called broadly.
It actually, most of the time has 20 percent better compression than GZIP.
Websites are starting to use in more and more right now, the adoption isn't 100 percent there yetand some browsers are still implementing default encoding by broadly.

### Database Scaling

6 main ways that databases can scale:

1. Identify Inefficient Queries
2. Increase Memory
3. Vertical Scaling(Redis, Memchached)
4. Sharding
5. More Database
6. Database Type

### Caching

Caching is the process of storing some data in cach.
Cache is a temporary storage component area where the data is stored so that in future data can be served faster.
We're able to access memory or access data a lot faster in our computers using CPU, ram and hard disks, what we can do the same similar principles in our applications.
For example, we use CDNs to cash our HTML and JavaScript files so that instead of the browser going all the way back to the server across the country, 
across the globe, it can just access the closest server, CDN and use the cached files.

If the API is really slow, we can also use caching on the database site and database servers will be configured out of the box, usually for optimal caching.
But they do also allow you to control and change parameters. All based on your needs.


### Load Balancing

### Ngnix

Advanced load Balancer, NGINX accelerates content and application delivery, improves security, and facilitates availability and scalability for the busiest websites on the Internet.

## 16. CI/CD

Implement Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment
